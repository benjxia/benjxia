## About Me

Hey there! I’m **benjxia**—a self employed chicken farmer near New Auckland, New Zealand. After a thrilling ride through internships that kept vanishing faster than a chicken at feeding time, I decided to trade in my keyboard for a coop. Chickens are less likely to rescind their offers.

## Shit I'm decent at

- **Computer Vision** (yes, really)
  - 3D Vision, both classic and deep learning—because if chickens can see in 3D, why can’t my models?
- **Bird Whispering**
  - I’ve raised parrots, finches, and chickens. Basically, if it’s got feathers, I’ll probably get attached.

## 🐦 Fun Facts

- My favorite co-workers have beaks.
- I can probably identify more bird species than most tech recruiters.
- If you ever need a neural net to track runaway chickens, hit me up.
